Tuio Implementation (thanks to TuioPad) http://code.google.com/p/tuiopad/
http://www.vimeo.com/19617650

Overview:
A native iPhone application based of off Marek Bereza's (http://www.mrkbrz.com/) browser based interface to ofxSimpleGuiToo (http://memo.tv/node/875). 

Using the version of ofxWebSimpleGuiToo included you can control parameters via the iPhone. The app current supports ofxSimpleGuiSliderInt, ofxSimpleGuiSliderFloat and ofxSimpleGuiToggle and ofxSimpleGuiComboBox

To test:
1. Run the ofxWebSimpleGuiTooExample.xcodeproj from the OF examples folder
2. Open ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/IOS_APPS/SimpleGuiRemote/SimpleGuiRemote.xcodeproj and Build and Run 
3. Add a Server via the + button (default port for the app is 8910) and connect


Built using the latest openframeworks from github
https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks

Will likely work with openFrameworks 0062 but you will have to find replace ofSetHexColor with ofSetColor

FILES:

ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/IOS_APPS/SimpleGuiRemote
iPhone native app that connects to ofxWebSimpleGuiToo and generates controls using UIKit's UISlider, UISwitch and UiPicker

ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/ofxWebSimpleGuiTooExample.xcodeproj
Openframeworks test project - based off Marek's original ofxWebSimpleGuiToo example (http://code.google.com/p/ofxmarek/downloads/list)

ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/addons/ofxSimpleGuiToo
slightly modified version of Memo's ofxSimpleGuiToo (https://github.com/memo/msalibs) to allow grabbing of controls from ComboBox


ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/IOS_APPS/PhoneGapApp/SimpleGuiApp
requires PhoneGap (http://www.phonegap.com/)

Good for testing the browser version of ofxWebSimpleGuiToo in the iPhone simulator. Also allows some special functionality that web apps only get when added to Home Screen via bookmarking


TODO/WISHLIST

- Fix Auto-Save Toggle
- clean up code (it doesn't leak according to my testing but data could be handled more elegantly)
- QR code generation by OF app of IP:PORT info
- Better layout support for iPad
