Overview:
A native iPhone application based of off Marek Bereza's (http://www.mrkbrz.com/) browser based interface to ofxSimpleGuiToo (http://memo.tv/node/875). 

Using the version of ofxWebSimpleGuiToo included you can control parameters via the iPhone. The app current supports ofxSimpleGuiSliderInt, ofxSimpleGuiSliderFloat and ofxSimpleGuiToggle and ofxSimpleGuiComboBox


Built using the latest openframeworks from github
https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks

Will likely work with openFrameworks 0062 but you will have to find replace ofSetHexColor with ofSetColor

FILES:

iPhone native app that connects to ofxWebSimpleGuiToo and generates controls using UIKit's UISlider, UISwitch and UiPicker

ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/ofxWebSimpleGuiTooExample.xcodeproj
Openframeworks test project - based off Marek's original ofxWebSimpleGuiToo example (http://code.google.com/p/ofxmarek/downloads/list)

ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/addons/ofxSimpleGuiToo
slightly modified version of Memo's ofxSimpleGuiToo (https://github.com/memo/msalibs) to allow grabbing of controls from ComboBox


ofxWebSimpleGuiToo-for-iPhone/IOS_APPS/PhoneGapApp/SimpleGuiApp
requires PhoneGap (http://www.phonegap.com/)

Good for testing the browser version of ofxWebSimpleGuiToo in the iPhone simulator. Also allows some special functionality that web apps only get when added to Home Screen via bookmarking


TODO/WISHLIST

- Fix Auto-Save Toggle
- Add mouse input (TUIO?)
- clean up code (it doesn't leak according to my testing but data could be handled more elegantly)
- QR code generation by OF app of IP:PORT info
